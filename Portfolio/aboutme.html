    <p>Hi, my names Katelyn and i'm 17 years old, i'm currently unemployed and this portfolio is aimed at an IT job for a potential employer. In this portfolio
    i talk about some of my hobbies and experiences in work and what skills I have learnt from those certain projects. For example I sometimes like to read stories and write them, reading stories has made
    me very creative with my own whilst I like the Mystery genre in stories the most, that gives me a lot of logical thinking, thats why I like mystery. I won 1st place in school for the best creative story and have an autograph of the author of a book as a reward.
    I grew up around computers and consoles, my dad taught me some code and how to mod games and thats what he enjoyed doing, aswell as he used to work at a computer office area, thats where i mostly got my interest in computers from. My number 3 interests I do almost daily include: Gaming, editing, and drawing.</p>
